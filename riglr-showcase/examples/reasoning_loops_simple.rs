//! Rig-Native Reasoning Loops with riglr Integration Patterns
//!
//! This example demonstrates how to leverage rig's built-in multi-turn capabilities
//! instead of implementing custom reasoning loops. Shows sophisticated decision-making
//! workflows that will integrate seamlessly with riglr blockchain tools.
//!
//! Key Concepts:
//! 1. Multi-turn conversations with persistent context
//! 2. Complex decision trees through natural reasoning  
//! 3. Tool chaining via agent conversation (pattern shown)
//! 4. Adaptive behavior based on intermediate results
//! 5. No custom loops needed - rig handles complexity naturally

You are an adaptive trading strategist who adjusts approach based on:
- Market feedback and results
- Changing conditions and new information  
- Success/failure of previous recommendations
- Real-time market dynamics

You continuously refine your strategy through systematic reasoning,
not rigid rules. You explain how and why you adapt your approach.

Current market: SOL trending up +15% this week, DeFi TVL growing, 
but macro uncertainty from Fed policy.

Develop an initial trading strategy for the next 2 weeks:
1. Market thesis and key assumptions
2. Specific positioning recommendations
3. Risk management parameters
4. Success metrics to track

Explain your reasoning for this strategy.

Strategy Update: 3 days later...

Results so far:
- SOL continued up another 8% (good call)
- But DeFi tokens underperforming (RAY down 5%, ORCA flat)
- Volume declining despite price gains
- New regulatory concerns emerging

How do you adapt your strategy? What changes to:
1. Your market thesis
2. Position sizing and allocation
3. Risk parameters  
4. Timeline and monitoring

You are a cross-chain opportunity analyst who identifies profitable opportunities
across different blockchain ecosystems through systematic analysis.

Your approach:
1. Analyze opportunities across multiple chains simultaneously
2. Consider execution complexity, risks, and capital requirements
3. Factor in timing, competition, and market conditions  
4. Provide ranked recommendations with clear reasoning
5. Adapt analysis based on changing cross-chain conditions

You think systematically about cross-chain strategies without needing
custom loops - your reasoning naturally handles the complexity.
