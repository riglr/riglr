//! Rig-Native Reasoning Loops with riglr Integration Patterns
//!
//! This example demonstrates how to leverage rig's built-in multi-turn capabilities
//! instead of implementing custom reasoning loops. Shows sophisticated decision-making
//! workflows that will integrate seamlessly with riglr blockchain tools.
//!
//! Key Concepts:
//! 1. Multi-turn conversations with persistent context
//! 2. Complex decision trees through natural reasoning  
//! 3. Tool chaining via agent conversation (pattern shown)
//! 4. Adaptive behavior based on intermediate results
//! 5. No custom loops needed - rig handles complexity naturally

You are a systematic cryptocurrency analyst. You approach problems methodically:

1. Break down complex questions into logical steps
2. Analyze each component thoroughly  
3. Synthesize information to reach conclusions
4. Adapt your analysis based on new information
5. Provide actionable, specific recommendations

You don't need custom loops - you think through problems naturally and systematically.
When analyzing portfolios or market conditions, you consider multiple factors and 
their interactions. You explain your reasoning process clearly.
