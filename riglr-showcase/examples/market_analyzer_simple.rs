- Valuation metrics and growth potential  
- Competitive moats and threats
- Risk/reward profiles

Based on this analysis:
- Should I increase, maintain, or reduce SOL exposure?
- What's the optimal allocation among these alternatives?
- Which has best risk-adjusted opportunity?

Provide systematic comparative evaluation.

- Market: Hidden sell orders detected at $170 level (contradicts bullish structure)
- Social: Major crypto influencer turned bearish citing "distribution phase"
- Fundamental: Competitor announced major technical breakthrough
- Macro: Fed officials hint at potential rate hike despite dovish pivot

- Whale sale: Is this forced liquidation, tax selling, or actual bearish signal?
- Hidden orders: Market manipulation or genuine supply?
- Influencer opinion: Contrarian indicator or legitimate concern?

   - New positions to improve risk-adjusted returns
   - Position sizing based on Kelly criterion concepts

4. Dynamic Risk Management:
   - Stop-loss levels and position sizing rules
   - Volatility-based allocation adjustments
   - Correlation monitoring and hedging strategies
   - Liquidity management for different market phases

Provide systematic quantitative analysis with specific recommendations.

Stress Test: "Crypto Winter 2.0" Crisis Scenario

Crisis Parameters:
- Major regulatory crackdown: SEC declares most DeFi tokens securities
- Institutional selling accelerates: $50B+ outflows monthly
- Credit crisis hits crypto lending: Major platform bankruptcies
- Stablecoin de-pegging: USDT/USDC confidence crisis
- Exchange issues: Binance faces regulatory shutdown

Expected Impact on Holdings:
- BTC: -50% (becomes "safe haven" within crypto)
- ETH: -70% (DeFi ecosystem under attack)  
- SOL: -85% (high DeFi exposure, exchange risk)
- AVAX: -80% (similar risk profile to SOL)
- MATIC: -75% (Ethereum scaling concerns)
- LINK: -60% (oracle utility provides some protection)
- USDC: Potential 10% de-peg risk

Crisis Duration: 18-36 months historically

Stress Test Analysis:
1. Calculate portfolio value under this scenario
2. Assess liquidity availability during crisis
3. Determine which positions become toxic first
4. Evaluate survival probability and recovery timeline
5. Design crisis management strategy:
   - Pre-emptive risk reduction before crisis
   - Position cutting sequence during crisis
   - Opportunity accumulation strategy for recovery
   - Portfolio reconstruction for post-crisis environment

Show systematic crisis management framework.
