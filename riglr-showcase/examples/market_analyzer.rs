PORTFOLIO STRESS TEST: Extreme market scenario simulation

CRISIS SCENARIO: "DeFi Winter" - Regulatory crackdown and liquidity crisis
- SEC classifies most DeFi tokens as securities
- Major exchanges delist altcoins in US
- Institutional selling accelerates 
- Credit crisis hits crypto lending protocols
- Stablecoin de-pegging concerns emerge

EXPECTED IMPACT ON HOLDINGS:
- BTC: -40% (flight to "safety" within crypto)
- ETH: -60% (DeFi ecosystem concerns)
- SOL: -75% (high DeFi exposure, exchange risk)
- AVAX: -70% (similar to ETH concerns)
- MATIC: -65% (Ethereum scaling, regulatory risk)
- LINK: -50% (oracle utility, some safety)
- USDC: Potential 5% depeg risk

MARKET CONDITIONS DURING CRISIS:
- Liquidity: Severely impaired, wide bid-ask spreads
- Correlations: All altcoins approach 1.0 with BTC/ETH
- Volatility: Extreme (150%+ annualized)
- Time horizon: 6-18 month crisis duration
- Recovery timeline: 2-4 years historically

STRESS TEST QUESTIONS:
1. Calculate exact portfolio value under this scenario
2. Determine if maximum drawdown exceeds my 50% tolerance
3. Identify which positions become illiquid first
4. Assess if I can meet my 6-month liquidity needs
5. Evaluate portfolio survival probability and recovery time

CRISIS ADAPTATION STRATEGY:
- Should I pre-emptively reduce risk before crisis hits?
- Which positions should be cut first if crisis emerges?
- How should I rebalance during the crisis for optimal recovery?
- What opportunities might emerge during maximum pessimism?
- How can I position for post-crisis recovery?

Please synthesize this multi-source intelligence into actionable investment insights.

My wallet for balance verification: {}

{}

Intelligence Synthesis Request:
1. Check my current SOL balance and position
2. Weight and evaluate each intelligence source:
   - Which signals are most reliable and significant?
   - Where do sources converge vs diverge?
   - How should conflicting signals be resolved?

3. Generate investment thesis:
   - Bull case scenario with price targets and timeline
   - Bear case risks and potential negative catalysts
   - Base case most likely outcome with probability
   - Key factors that would change the thesis

4. Create actionable trading strategy:
   - Optimal entry levels and position sizing
   - Risk management and stop-loss levels
   - Profit-taking strategy and target allocations
   - Timeline for investment thesis to play out

5. Identify key monitoring criteria:
   - Which data sources to track most closely
   - Early warning signals that thesis is breaking down  
   - Catalysts that could accelerate the thesis
   - Rebalancing triggers and decision points

6. Generate confidence assessment:
   - Overall conviction level (1-10 scale)
   - Risk-adjusted expected return
   - Probability-weighted outcomes
   - Comparison to alternative investment opportunities

Provide specific recommendations with quantitative targets and reasoning.

INTELLIGENCE UPDATE: Contradictory signals emerging - need conflict resolution

NEW CONFLICTING INFORMATION:
- On-chain: Whale addresses actually distributed 1.5M SOL (previous data was wrong)
- Market data: Large options position expires Friday, could trigger volatility
- Social: Major influencer turned bearish, citing technical concerns
- Macro: Fed hawkish comments suggest possible rate hike, risk-off sentiment
- Fundamental: Competitor (Ethereum L2) announced major improvement, threatens market share

INTELLIGENCE CONFLICTS TO RESOLVE:
1. Whale behavior: Accumulation vs distribution (which data is correct?)
2. Market structure: Bullish flow vs volatility risk from options expiry
3. Sentiment: Community optimism vs influential bearish opinions
4. Macro backdrop: Crypto-friendly regulation vs monetary tightening risk
5. Competitive position: Solana improvements vs Ethereum L2 competition

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY CHALLENGE:
How do you handle contradictory intelligence sources? Please demonstrate:

1. Information verification: How to determine which sources are more reliable
2. Signal weighting: How to weight conflicting information appropriately
3. Uncertainty quantification: How to express confidence with conflicting data
4. Decision making: How to make investment decisions with incomplete/conflicting info
5. Adaptive thesis: How to update investment thesis as new information emerges

SPECIFIC CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
Given these new contradictory signals, should the investment thesis change?
- What's the new bull/bear/base case probability distribution?
- How should position sizing adjust for increased uncertainty?
- What additional data would help resolve the key conflicts?
- What's the decision framework when intelligence sources disagree?

Show your systematic approach to handling contradictory market intelligence.
