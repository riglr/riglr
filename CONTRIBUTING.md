- **Use `cargo fmt`** for consistent formatting
- **Address `cargo clippy` warnings**
- **Write comprehensive documentation** with examples
- **Include unit and integration tests**

### Error Handling

- **Use `Result<T, E>` types** for all fallible operations
- **Avoid `.unwrap()` and `.expect()`** in production code
- **Create specific error types** using `thiserror`
- **Provide helpful error messages** that guide users toward solutions

### Async Code

- **Use `tokio` as the async runtime**
- **Implement `Send + Sync`** for all async types
- **Use `async-trait` when needed**
- **Handle cancellation gracefully**

### Documentation

- **Document all public APIs** with doc comments
- **Include examples** in doc comments when helpful
- **Write crate-level documentation** explaining purpose and usage
- **Update README files** when adding new features

### Testing

- **Write unit tests** for individual functions and methods
- **Write integration tests** for crate-level functionality  
- **Use meaningful test names** that describe what's being tested
- **Mock external dependencies** in tests
- **Test error conditions** as well as happy paths

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Testing Strategy

This project uses a two-tiered testing approach:

#### Unit Tests (Default)
Run locally with: `cargo test`
- Executes quickly (2-5 minutes)
- Provides quick feedback during development
- Runs in main CI for every PR
- Does not require external dependencies

#### Integration Tests
Integration tests require Docker and are controlled by a feature flag.

**Prerequisites**: Docker must be running

Run integration tests with:
```bash
# Run integration tests for a specific package
cargo test --package riglr-core --features integration-tests
cargo test --package riglr-evm-tools --features integration-tests
cargo test --package riglr-solana-tools --features integration-tests

# Run all tests including integration tests
cargo test --all-features
```

Integration tests automatically:
- Spin up Redis instances for testing queues and idempotency stores
- Launch Ethereum nodes (Anvil) for EVM integration tests
- Start Solana validators for Solana integration tests

#### All Tests
Run locally with: `cargo test --all-features`
- Executes all tests (unit + integration)
- Use before submitting significant changes
- Requires Docker to be running

#### Adding New Tests
- Use `#[cfg(feature = "integration-tests")]` for tests requiring Docker/external services
- Do NOT use `#[ignore]` for new integration tests
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Unit Tests

Place unit tests in the same file as the code being tested:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_job_creation() {
        let job = Job::new("test_tool", serde_json::json!({}));
        assert_eq!(job.tool_name, "test_tool");
        assert_eq!(job.max_retries, 3); // default value
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_async_function() {
        // Test async functionality
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

Place integration tests in the `tests/` directory:

```rust
// tests/integration_test.rs
use riglr_core::{JobQueue, InMemoryJobQueue};

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_job_queue_integration() {
    let queue = InMemoryJobQueue::new();
    // Test full workflow
}
```

## üìã Test Requirements and Known Issues

### Build and Compilation Notes

Some tests may have longer compilation times due to dependencies:
- **riglr-agents**: Many dependencies, longer compilation time
- **riglr-events-core**: Heavy async test setup
- **riglr-evm-tools**: Requires actual RPC endpoints for network tests

### Required Test Environment

For integration tests to pass, you may need:
- **API Keys**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`
- **Local Services**: Redis (localhost:6379), PostgreSQL, Neo4j
- **Network Access**: For blockchain RPC calls and API providers
- **Test Wallets**: Pre-funded wallets on testnets (never use mainnet keys!)

### Known Test Issues

- **Timeouts**: Some blockchain RPC tests may timeout on slow connections
- **Rate Limiting**: Free tier API keys may hit limits during full test suite
- **Ignored Tests**: Tests marked `#[ignore]` may require specific setup or paid services
- **CI Environments**: Some tests may fail in CI without proper secrets setup

### System Requirements

- **Rust**: 1.75+ with cargo
- **Memory**: 8GB+ RAM for parallel test execution
- **Disk**: ~5GB for build artifacts
- **OS**: Linux/macOS/WSL2 recommended

## üß™ End-to-End Integration Tests

**üìö For detailed E2E testing documentation, see [tests/E2E_TESTS_README.md](tests/E2E_TESTS_README.md)**

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
./scripts/run_e2e_tests.sh

# Run specific suite
./scripts/run_e2e_tests.sh --suite 1

# Keep services running after tests
./scripts/run_e2e_tests.sh --keep-running
```

### Test Suites Overview

2. **Use the `#[tool]` macro** for automatic rig integration
3. **Include comprehensive error handling**
4. **Add examples** in the `examples/` directory

### New Crates

1. **Discuss the need** in an issue first
2. **Follow naming convention**: `riglr-{functionality}`
3. **Include proper `Cargo.toml` metadata**
4. **Add to workspace members**
5. **Create comprehensive documentation**

## üìû Getting Help

- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions about usage or development
- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **Code Review**: Don't hesitate to ask for help in PRs

## üéâ Recognition

All contributors will be:

- **Listed in CONTRIBUTORS.md**
- **Mentioned in release notes** for significant contributions
- **Invited to join** the riglr organization (for regular contributors)

## üîß CI Integration Tests Setup

### Required Secrets

The integration tests require the following secrets to be configured in your GitHub repository settings:

#### Blockchain Test Keys

These should be test-only private keys with minimal funds on testnets:

- `SOLANA_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY`: Base58-encoded Solana private key for devnet testing
- `EVM_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY`: Hex-encoded Ethereum private key for Sepolia testnet
- `HYPERLIQUID_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for Hyperliquid testnet (if applicable)

#### API Keys

These are for external service integrations:

- `DEXSCREENER_API_KEY`: API key for DexScreener service
- `LUNARCRUSH_API_KEY`: API key for LunarCrush social analytics
- `CROSS_CHAIN_TEST_KEYS`: JSON object with bridge service API keys

### Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to your repository's Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add each secret with the appropriate name and value
4. Ensure test keys only have minimal testnet funds

### Test Workflow

The integration tests run in several scenarios:

1. **Scheduled**: Daily at 2 AM UTC to catch external API changes
2. **Manual Trigger**: Via workflow_dispatch for debugging
3. **Push to main/develop**: For repository owners only
4. **Pull Requests**: From the main repository (not forks)

For pull requests from forks, mock integration tests run instead to ensure code quality without exposing secrets.

### Local Testing

To run integration tests locally:

```bash
# Set up environment variables
export SOLANA_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY="your-test-key"
export EVM_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY="your-test-key"
export SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://api.devnet.solana.com"
export ETHEREUM_RPC_URL="https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com"

# Run specific integration tests
cargo test --package riglr-solana-tools --test integration
cargo test --package riglr-evm-tools --test integration
cargo test --package riglr-showcase --test showcase_e2e
```

### Security Considerations

- **Never use production keys**: All keys should be for testnets only
- **Minimal funds**: Test accounts should have only enough funds for testing
- **Rotate regularly**: Change test keys periodically for security
- **Monitor usage**: Check test account activity regularly
- **Fork safety**: Integration tests with real services don't run on fork PRs

### Troubleshooting

#### Tests Failing Due to Rate Limits

If tests fail due to rate limiting:
1. Reduce test frequency
2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Consider using mock services for most tests

#### Network Issues

For network-related failures:
1. Check if the RPC endpoints are operational
2. Verify network connectivity in CI environment
3. Consider using fallback RPC endpoints

#### Secret Not Available

If secrets aren't available:
1. Verify secret names match exactly
2. Check repository settings for secret visibility
3. Ensure workflow has permission to access secrets
